    <h1>General</h1>
    <p>In general Diabetes is a disease that occurs when your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high. 
        Blood glucose is your main source of energy and comes from the food you eat. Insulin, a hormone made by the 
        pancreas, helps glucose from food get into you cells to be used for energy.. Absence or insufficient production of 
        insulin, or an inability of the body to properly use insulin causes diabetes.Over time, having too much sugar in your 
        blood can harm your body. Diabetes can damage blood cells. It puts you at risk for a heart attack, stroke, poor circulation, 
        or other problems as a result. Damaged blood vessels in your kidneys can stop them from working the way they should.But if it 
        is treated early and protect your self this damages will not happen.A blood sugar level less than 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) is normal.
         A reading of more than 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) after two hours indicates diabetes. A reading between 140 and 199 mg/dL 
         (7.8 mmol/L and 11.0 mmol/L) indicates prediabetes.
