    <h1>what to do</h1>
<p1>If you have diabetes, you should try to keep your blood sugar level as close as possible to that of someone who doesnâ€™t 
have diabetes. This may not be possible or right for everyone. Check with your doctor about what the right range of blood
sugar is for you.You will get plenty of help in learning how to do this from your health care team, which is made up of your
doctor, nurses, and dietitian.Bring a family member or friend with you when you see your doctor. Ask lots of questions.
Before you leave, be sure you understand everything you need to know about taking care of your diabetes.

 <p2>The foods on your diabetes eating plan are the same ones that are good for everyone. Try to stick to things that are
 low in fat, salt, and sugar and high in fiber, like beans, fruits, vegetables, and grains.If you use insulin;give 
yourself an insulin shot,eat about the same amount of food each day at about the same time,don't skip meals,especially
 you have already given your self an insulin shot,your blood sugar may go low.And if you are cafe user you can get a 
especial access to healthy food by using a certificate which is signed by doctors.Since the insulin need to be away from 
sunlight and heat you must keep it between 13.3-26.6 degree celsious.In university there might not be a refrigerator which can be 
accessibile you can use sand and water mixture to keep the bottle cool.
